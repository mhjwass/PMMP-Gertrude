## PMMP-Gertrude, a Minecraft: Bedrock Edition

PMMP-Gertrude software is based on Lifeboat's Steadfast2. The goal of PMMP-Gertrude is to ensure maximum performance while also having the latest features. This software is highly optimized thus lacking features that you might want. The ideal use for this software is to run a lobby in which there will be a lot of players. We are working on adding features (mostly functions) from
<a href="https://pmmp.io"> PMMP</a> to PMMP-Gertrude to help us and you get even faster while coding.


## Additions to PMMP-Gertrude

 * A more organised way to store configs
 * A way to enable or disable commands in the YML file of the software
 * An easier way to create Entities using the `createBaseNBT` function
 * The removal of non-crucial features like OP command, say command, etc... (Bear in mind you can still use all the op functions like `setOp` and the op.txt to set/remove a player as an Operator. Only the commands were removed to eliminate congestion and for potential security breaches)
