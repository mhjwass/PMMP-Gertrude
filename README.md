## QuiverMine Minecraft: Bedrock Edition

QuiverMine software is based on Lifeboat's Steadfast2. The goal of QuiverMine is to ensure maximum performance while also having the latest features. This software is tailored to the needs of our server, QuiverMC. We are working on adding features (mostly functions) from
<a href="https://pmmp.io"> PMMP</a> to QuiverMine to help us get even faster while coding.


## Additions to QuiverMine

 * A more organised way to store configs
 * A way to enable or disable commands in the YML file of the software
 * An easier way to create Entities using the `createBaseNBT` function
 * The removal of non-crucial features like OP command, say command, etc... (Bear in mind you can still use all the op functions like `setOp` and the op.txt to set/remove a player as an Operator. Only the commands were removed to eliminate congestion and for potential security breaches)
