## Project-Survivia Minecraft: Bedrock Edition

Project-Survivia software is based on Lifeboat's Steadfast2. The goal of Project-Survivia is to ensure maximum performance while also having the latest features. This software is tailored to the needs of our server, Project-Survivia. We are working on adding features (mostly functions) from
<a href="https://pmmp.io"> PMMP</a> to Project-Survivia to help us get even faster while coding.


## Additions to Project-Survivia

 * A more organised way to store configs
 * A way to enable or disable commands in the YML file of the software
 * An easier way to create Entities using the `createBaseNBT` function
 * The removal of non-crucial features like OP command, say command, etc... (Bear in mind you can still use all the op functions like `setOp` and the op.txt to set/remove a player as an Operator. Only the commands were removed to eliminate congestion and for potential security breaches)
