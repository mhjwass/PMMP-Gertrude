#QuiverMine Minecraft: Bedrock Edition
QuiverMine software is based on Lifeboat's Steadfast2. We will update this fork to our needs. This software will be the same software that will be used on QuiverNetwork Servers. 

This software is not community driven. We will add in features that we lack on our server, but we will keep pulling updates from HYDREON.

Any pull requests about adding features or asking how to run / compile the source code will be ignored.

Contributors are free to edit and improve the code. Thanks!
